Teammates have built in abilities that let them collaborate with you and the outside world.

### Email

Every teammate has a unique email address that you can send email to and they will determine the best course of action. Their email address is intentionally a little cryptic so only you know it and other people don't start emailing them by mistake. But if you give your teammate a GMail account, you can set up emailing forwarding so they'll have a nice email at your domain.

### Chat

While most folks prefer to chat with their teammates in Slack, out of the box they can use our in-app chat interface to get to know your teammate better. You can assign them tasks, learn about their abilities, setup rules and playbooks, and even ask how to use the Teammates app.

Chatting with your teammates is a great way to get started\!

### Webhooks

Every teammate has their own unique public URL that listens for webhooks from 3rd party applications. You can copy-paste their URL into any app that has a webhook feature and the content will get POSTed to the teammate.

Out of the box, the teammate will likely ignore the webhooks -- you haven't told them what to do with them yet\! You can either hop into Chat/Slack and explain it to them (e.g. "When you get a notification about a new signup, add them to the google sheet") or setup more advanced Rules in the Teammates dashboard.
