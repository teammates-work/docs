One of the most natural ways to collaborate with your teammates is just like you do with your human colleagues -- in Google Workspace.
You can give your teammates their own Gmail addresses where you can email with them, share Google Docs and Sheets with them, let them manage files in their own Google Drive, and more.

### How it Works

One of the most special parts about teammates is that they work seamlessly in 3rd party apps like THEMSELVES.
When you want them to update a Google Sheet, you don't give them access to _your_ Google Account. Instead, you give them their own Google Account and let them manage the files on their own.

And once your teammate has a Google account, you can interact with them just like regular employees on your team. 
You can send them email, share Google Sheets with them, tag them in Google Docs comments... anything you would do with a human colleague you can do with a teammate.

<Tip>
Because teammates are not real people, during setup, you'll need to act as their "manager". You will have access to their password and easily toggle between your own Google Account and theirs.

### Setup

#### Create Their Google Account

First, you need to create a new Google Account for your teammate. If you are the administrator of the Google Workspace account, [add a new user](https://support.google.com/a/answer/33310?hl=en&co=DASHER._Family%3DDomain-verified) just like you would with a new employee on your team.
If you are not the administrator, ask your administrator to add a new user. You can pick the name and email address -- likely following your company's naming convention.

<Note>
You must use YOUR email address as the Secondary Email Address. This will allow you to get the new user welcome email and set their password.

#### Setup Your Teammate's Profile and Picture

It's no fun to see generic details for your teammate. Let's make them look good!

After you login as your teammate, go to the [Personal Info section](https://myaccount.google.com/u/1/personal-info) on their Google Account page. 
There you can modify their name, add a profile picture, and more.

#### Setup Gmail Forwarding

You'll want all incoming GMail to be forwarded to your teammate's internal email address.

1. First you'll need to find your teammate's internal email address. In the teammate's app, click their Profile and look for their `Email` field.
1. Log into your teammate's Gmail account. Click the gear icon in the top right and select `More Settings` and click `Forwarding`
1. Click `Add a forwarding address`
1. Enter your teammate's internal email address. Note: You may need to go through a verification step to confirm you have access to the email address. If so, you can find the incoming email in the Teammate dashboard under [Audit Logs](https://app.teammates.work/audits).
1. Confirm the forwarding address and click `Save Changes`

#### Adding Google Workspace Accounts to Teammate Profiles

If you're using Google Workspace at your company, you can easily connect your Google account to your Teammate profile. This allows Teammates to use your Google Workspace email instead of your default internal email address.

Here's how to add your Google Workspace account:

1. Log in to the Teammates app
2. Navigate to your Profile settings
3. Find the "External Email" field
4. Enter your Google Workspace email address (e.g., yourname@yourcompany.com)
5. Save your changes

<Note>
When you set your external email, Teammates will automatically use this address instead of your internal email for all communications.
</Note>

This integration is especially helpful for teams that primarily use Google Workspace for their daily communications, ensuring everything stays in one place!

That's it! Go send your teammate an email congratulating them on their new Google Workspace account and put them to work!
