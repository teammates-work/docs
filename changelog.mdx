## Week of 2024-12-20

Virtual teammates can now communicate through both internal chat and Slack, enhancing collaboration across your preferred messaging platforms. They'll engage in natural dialogue, asking clarifying questions and seeking approval before sending messages to ensure accurate and appropriate communication.

- **[Improvement]** üó£Ô∏è More natural Slack conversations

Now your teammates can chat more naturally in Slack without having to @-mention for every response. Just like a regular conversation, once you're engaged in a thread, you can keep the discussion flowing smoothly. No more awkward mention-tagging every time you want to say something! üòå

This makes team discussions feel more organic and less robotic, helping everyone stay focused on what matters - the actual conversation.

- **[Feature]**: Your teammates are now webhook-ready! üéØ Each teammate gets their own unique URL to receive updates from your favorite tools. Just point your webhooks their way, and they'll intuitively process incoming notifications with deep understanding - whether it's a GitHub issue, a Slack message, or any other integration. No more complex setup - your teammates naturally grasp what to do!
- **[Feature]**: üìÖ Schedule assignments for when you need them

You can now schedule assignments to run at the perfect time for your workflow. Whether you need research done next week or want to automate recurring tasks, we've got you covered:

- Schedule one-time assignments for any future date and time
- Set up recurring assignments that run automatically (e.g., every Wednesday at 8 AM)
- Maintain flexibility by choosing between immediate or scheduled execution

This new scheduling capability helps you plan ahead and automate routine work, letting you focus on what matters most.

## Week of 2024-12-06
- **[Improvement]**: Our `AnalyzeData` skill just got a brain boost! üß† We've fine-tuned it to be more specific about data analysis and added some guardrails to prevent data hallucination. It's like giving our skill a pair of data-focused glasses!
- **[Feature]**: Say goodbye to the silent treatment! üôÖ‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è The `AnalyzeData` skill now comes with built-in error messaging. If it encounters empty data, it'll let you know instead of just staring blankly at the void.
- **[Improvement]**: Improved LLM guidance to prevent data hallucination

## Week of 2024-11-29
- **[Feature]**: Your teammates can now join you and your team in Slack. You can invite them to channels, @-mention them, and DM them.

## Week of 2024-11-22
- **[Feature]**: Chat just got a whole lot more interactive. You can now assign tasks, get help using Teammates, ask questions, and change your teammates' behavior. "Um can you be less sarcastic?" and they'll remember it (but not sure why you'd ever want that)
- **[Skill Update]**: Teammates can specify specific sites with `News Search` skill to only retrieve news from specific sources/publications e.g. "Get me top 5 headlines from TechCrunch".
- **[Skill Update]**: Teammates can now write code in any programming language with the `Write Code` skill, not just Python. FizzBuzz in FORTRAN anyone?

## Week of 2024-11-15
- **[Feature]**: Introducing `News Search` skill. Your teammates can now search for the latest news and current events in real-time. They are no longer limited to just web search and historical research.
- **[Feature]**: Introducing `Add to Knowledge Base` skill, empowering teammates to explicitly store information in their knowledge base for future reference.
- **[Skill Update]**: `Analyze Data` skill can now take references to large files, not just inline data.

## Week of 2024-11-08
- **[Feature]**: Introducing `Search to Knowledge Base` skill, enabling teammates to search a company knowledge base (ours or your own!) for information relevant to the conversation.
- **[Feature]**: A brand new Chat UI. Chat with your teammates about themselves, their Squad, their recent assignments, and more.
- **[Improvement]**: `Human in the Loop` alerts now clearly specify why they are interrupting you: do they need clarification, approval, access to skills/resources, or something else.
- **[Improvement]**: Assignments that are waiting on others more clearly specify if they are waiting for human input (via "Human in the Loop") or for another teammate to finish their work.
- **[Improvement]**: You can now give teammates custom roles beyond our pre-defined templates. Let 1,000 "Assistant to the Regional Managers" bloom!
