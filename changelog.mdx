## Week of 2025-05-05

- **[New Skill] Query Database Skill – Your virtual teammates can now access your company databases directly!**

Your teammates just got a whole lot smarter! Starting today, your virtual teammates can write SQL queries to access any Postgres database you connect them to. This means they can both read and write company data without breaking a sweat.

Think of all the possibilities! Your teammates can now keep track of their work, update records, and pull information whenever needed. No more switching between tools or manual data entry – your virtual teammates handle it all.

This new skill is a game-changer for creating more sophisticated workflows. Whether it's tracking customer interactions, managing inventory, or analyzing trends – your teammates are ready to dive into your databases and make magic happen!

What will you build with this powerful new capability?

- **[Feature]** Teammates can now process files uploaded directly to Slack! Simply upload a document and your Teammate will be able to analyze, summarize, or extract information from it without leaving your conversation.
- **[Skill Update]** We've enhanced the 'Describe Image' skill with more detailed analysis and improved accuracy! Your Teammates can now provide richer descriptions of visual content, identify more elements, and better understand context in images.

## Week of 2025-04-08

- **[Feature]** It's a SmartTool explosion! We've just empowered your Teammates to access thousands of third-party SaaS products, APIs, and other digital tools, from Salesforce to Gmail to GitHub to Spotify to Cal.com to Canva to Attio and so many more! Your teammates are truly limited only by their imagination!

---

## Week of 2025-04-01

- **[Improvement]** Using third-party tools is now an inherent skill for all teammates, removing the need to explicitly enable it in the settings. This streamlines the teammate configuration process and ensures all your virtual teammates can seamlessly access and utilize external applications without additional setup.
- **[Feature]** Personal Smart Tools for each teammate! Now every AI agent on your team can connect their own individual accounts to third-party services like Gmail and Salesforce. This means each virtual teammate works with their unique identity and permissions, rather than sharing a single connection for the entire account. Your sales rep teammates can use their own Salesforce logins, support agent teammates can send emails that come from their personal work addresses, and every teammate maintains their distinct presence across all integrated tools.

## Week of 2025-03-24

- **[Feature]** Linear Support for Teammates: Great news! Starting this week, your Teammates can now be directly assigned issues in Linear. This seamless integration means your team members can work on assigned Linear issues within their familiar Teammates workflow. The best part? You have complete control over how your team interacts with these issues—set up custom processes like having Teammates focus only on items in "To Do" status. This integration bridges the gap between your project management and team collaboration tools, making your workflow more efficient and keeping everyone aligned without switching between platforms.
- **[Improvement]** The "Provide Feedback" button now disappears after feedback submission, preventing duplicate submissions and providing clear visual confirmation that your feedback has been received.

No more reformatting AI-generated content—get what you need, exactly how you need it, right from the start!

## Week of 2025-02-15

- **[Feature]** Your teammates are now webhook-ready! Each teammate gets their own unique URL to receive updates from your favorite tools. Just point your webhooks their way, and they'll intuitively process incoming notifications with deep understanding - whether it's a GitHub issue, a Slack message, or any other integration. No more complex setup - your teammates naturally grasp what to do!
- **[Feature]** You can now schedule assignments to run at the perfect time for your workflow. Whether you need research done next week or want to automate recurring tasks, we've got you covered:

  - Maintain flexibility by choosing between immediate or scheduled execution

- **[Feature]** Chat just got a whole lot more interactive. You can now assign tasks, get help using Teammates, ask questions, and change your teammates' behavior. "Um can you be less sarcastic?" and they'll remember it (but not sure why you'd ever want that)
- **[Skill Update]** Teammates can specify specific sites with `News Search` skill to only retrieve news from specific sources/publications e.g. "Get me top 5 headlines from TechCrunch".
- **[Skill Update]** Teammates can now write code in any programming language with the `Write Code` skill, not just Python. FizzBuzz in FORTRAN anyone?
