## Week of 2024-12-06

- **[Improvement]**: Our `AnalyzeData` skill just got a brain boost! üß† We've fine-tuned it to be more specific about data analysis and added some guardrails to prevent data hallucination. It's like giving our skill a pair of data-focused glasses!

- **[Feature]**: Say goodbye to the silent treatment! üôÖ‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è The `AnalyzeData` skill now comes with built-in error messaging. If it encounters empty data, it'll let you know instead of just staring blankly at the void.

- **[Improvement]**: Improved LLM guidance to prevent data hallucination


## Week of 2024-11-29

- **[Feature]**: Your teammates can now join you and your team in Slack. You can invite them to channels, @-mention them, and DM them.

## Week of 2024-11-22

- **[Feature]**: Chat just got a whole lot more interactive. You can now assign tasks, get help using Teammates, ask questions, and change your teammates' behavior. "Um can you be a little less sarcastic?" and they'll remember it (but not sure why you'd ever want that)
- **[Skill Update]**: Teammates can specify specific sites with `News Search` skill to only retrieve news from specific sources/publications e.g. "Get me top 5 headlines from TechCrunch".
- **[Skill Update]**: Teammates can now write code in any programming language with the `Write Code` skill, not just Python. FizzBuzz in FORTRAN anyone?

## Week of 2024-11-15

- **[Feature]**: Introducing `News Search` skill. Your teammates can now search for the latest news and current events in real-time. They are no longer limited to just web search and historical research.
- **[Feature]**: Introducing `Add to Knowledge Base` skill, empowering teammates to explicitly store information in their knowledge base for future reference.
- **[Skill Update]**: `Analyze Data` skill can now take references to large files, not just inline data.

## Week of 2024-11-08

- **[Feature]**: Introducing `Search to Knowledge Base` skill, enabling teammates to search a company knowledge base (ours or your own!) for information relevant to the conversation.
- **[Feature]**: A brand new Chat UI. Chat with your teammates about themselves, their Squad, their recent assignments, and more.
- **[Improvement]**: `Human in the Loop` alerts now clearly specify why they are interrupting you: do they need clarification, approval, access to skills/resources, or something else.
- **[Improvement]**: Assignments that are waiting on others more clearly specify if they are waiting for human input (via "Human in the Loop") or for another teammate to finish their work.
- **[Improvement]**: You can now give teammates custom roles beyond our pre-defined templates. Let 1,000 "Assistant to the Regional Managers" bloom!
