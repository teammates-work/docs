description: What's new with Teammates
---

## Week of 2024-11-29

- **[Improvement]**: We've given our skills a makeover! The `AnalyzeData` and `TransformData` skills now have a more organized structure, making them easier to use and maintain.

- **[Feature]**: Our skills are now data-type wizards! They can handle arrays, hashes, and strings like a pro, ensuring consistent formatting across all skill types.

- **[Under the Hood]**: We've added a bunch of new tests to make sure our `AnalyzeData`, `TransformData`, and `Reason` skills are working their magic correctly. It's like giving them a regular check-up to keep them in tip-top shape!

- **[Documentation]**: We've added new evaluation files with test cases and examples. It's like a cookbook for our skills, showing you all the delicious ways you can use them!

- **[Feature]**: Your teammates can now join you and your team in Slack. You can invite them to channels, @-mention them, and DM them.

## Week of 2024-11-22

- **[Feature]**: Chat just got a whole lot more interactive. You can now assign tasks, get help using Teammates, ask questions, and change your teammates' behavior. "Um can you be a little less sarcastic?" and they'll remember it (but not sure why you'd ever want that)
- **[Skill Update]**: Teammates can specify specific sites with `News Search` skill to only retrieve news from specific sources/publications e.g. "Get me top 5 headlines from TechCrunch".
- **[Skill Update]**: Teammates can now write code in any programming language with the `Write Code` skill, not just Python. FizzBuzz in FORTRAN anyone?

## Week of 2024-11-15

- **[Feature]**: Introducing `News Search` skill. Your teammates can now search for the latest news and current events in real-time. They are no longer limited to just web search and historical research.
- **[Feature]**: Introducing `Add to Knowledge Base` skill, empowering teammates to explicitly store information in their knowledge base for future reference.
- **[Skill Update]**: `Analyze Data` skill can now take references to large files, not just inline data.

## Week of 2024-11-08

- **[Feature]**: Introducing `Search to Knowledge Base` skill, enabling teammates to search a company knowledge base (ours or your own!) for information relevant to the conversation.
- **[Feature]**: A brand new Chat UI. Chat with your teammates about themselves, their Squad, their recent assignments, and more.
- **[Improvement]**: `Human in the Loop` alerts now clearly specify why they are interrupting you: do they need clarification, approval, access to skills/resources, or something else.
- **[Improvement]**: Assignments that are waiting on others more clearly specify if they are waiting for human input (via "Human in the Loop") or for another teammate to finish their work.
- **[Improvement]**: You can now give teammates custom roles beyond our pre-defined templates. Let 1,000 "Assistant to the Regional Managers" bloom!
