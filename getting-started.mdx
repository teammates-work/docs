## Getting Started: Onboard Your First Teammate

Ready to get going? Let's walk through designing and onboarding your first Teammate.

### 1. Design Your Teammate

Click the **"\+ button"** at the top of the page to create a new teammate.

- **Form:** Pick a fun formâ€”robot, alien, turkey, or your favorite animal. (This part is just for fun\!)
- **Role:** Choose a role, like Marketing Manager or Research Assistant. Try to pick a "real" job title, not just a description of a workflow e.g. "Accounts Payable Specialist" is better than "Invoice Reviewer"
- **Name:** Give your Teammate a name.
- **Job Description:** Write a short description, e.g., "You help our VP finance with invoices, expense reports, and other financial documents."

<Tip>
  Make your teammate fun and interesting\! You'll be spending time interacting with them, so make them someone you'd enjoy. If your company has a mascot, that's a great source of inspiration.
</Tip>

There's lots more settings you can configure, but this is a good start. We'll come back to those later.

### 2. Say "hi" to them

Click on the "Chat" tab to say hi to your teammate. Introduce yourself, and ask "What can you do?" and see how your Teammate responds\!

### 3. Give them their first assignment

Click on the Assignments tab. You can now type in a description of the work you want your teammate to do. Let's start super simple... try something like: "What day is today?"
