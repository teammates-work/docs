## Getting Started: Onboard Your First Teammate

Ready to get going? Let's walk through designing and onboarding your first Teammate.

---

### 1. Design Your Teammate

- **Form:** Pick a fun formâ€”robot, alien, turkey, or your favorite animal. (This part is just for fun!)
- **Role:** Choose a role, like Marketing Manager or Research Assistant. Try to pick a "real" job title
- **Name:** Give your Teammate a name.
- **Job Description:** Write a short description, e.g., "You help plan our social media campaigns." 

### 2. Chat With Your Teammate

Say hi and ask, "What can you do?" See how your Teammate responds!

### 3. Give Their First Assignment

Start simple: try something like, "What day is today?"

Keep experimenting and have fun. Your Teammate is here to help you succeed!
