## Quickstart: Set Up Your First Teammate

Ready to get going? Let's walk through creating your first Teammate. You can do it!

### 1. Design Your Teammate

- **Form:** Pick a fun formâ€”robot, alien, turkey, or your favorite animal. (This part is just for fun!)
- **Role:** Choose a role, like Marketing Manager or Research Assistant.
- **Name:** Give your Teammate a name.
- **Job Description:** Write a short description, e.g., "You help plan our social media campaigns."

### 2. Chat With Your Teammate

Say hi and ask, "What can you do?" See how your Teammate responds!

### 3. Give Their First Assignment

Start simple: try something like, "What day is today?"
