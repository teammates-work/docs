Teammate is an end-to-end platform to build and manage an entirely digital workforce. 

Teammates are autonomous employees: intelligent, intuitive, and fully embedded in your company's workflows. They don't wait for prompts. They don't need lots of instructions. They get to work.

Go beyond automation. You're not here to set up another bot, flowchart, or dashboard. It's a new paradigm.

## What is a Teammate?

A **Teammate** is a virtual employee that:

- Lives inside your existing tools (Slack, Docs, email, CRM)
- Takes on real recurring work, not just tasks
- Plans and replans its own workflows
- Collaborates naturally with your team
- Learns your org, your norms, your way of working

You don't configure a Teammate. You onboard them just like you would a new hire. You assign real work, give feedback, and watch them evolve.

## Why Teammates?

Traditional automation made a dent in simple tasks. Teammates go after the rest.

### Intuition

They don't need perfect instructions. Teammates handle vague, messy, or novel situations with context and clarity. They interpret goals, navigate ambiguity, and self-direct toward outcomes. No code. No prompting. No flowcharts.

### Autonomy

They plan their own work, decide what to do next, and adapt as things change. Whether it's a triggered alert, a scheduled job, or a teammate tagging them in a doc, they know when to act—and when to pause for guidance.

### Collaboration

They work with your team, not just for them. Teammates participate in threads, comments, handoffs, and shared tools. They understand context, hold memory, and navigate across people and departments without confusion.

### Evolution

They learn how your company works—its pace, tone, structure, and tools. The more you give them, the smarter and more aligned they become. You don't write their playbook. They write it themselves.
