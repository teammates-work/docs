Teammates can collaborate and work together in one of two ways:

### Delegate Task
Teammates can delegate tasks to each other. This is useful when a teammate is not able to complete a task, or when a task is too complex for a single teammate to complete.
For example, 

When a task is delegated, the first teammate will wait for the second teammate to complete the task. They will be in a "Waiting for Others" state and get notified when the task is complete.


<Tip>
Example: a Marketing Manager might delegate to a Copywriter to write a compelling product description, and then delegate to a Graphic Designer to create a cool image. The Marketing Manager can't complete this on their own and needs the help of the Copywriter and Graphic Designer.
</Tip>

### Notify Teammate
Sometimes a teammate does NOT have a dependency on another teammate nor need them to complete a particular task, but rather, they have want to just let others know about an event, just in case they care.

It's then up to the recipient teammate to decide if they want to take action on the notification. By default, they likely won't do anything with the notification other than shrug their shoulders. But if you tell them you'd like them to take action, usually by [setting up a Rule](./rules), they'll jump right in.

<Tip>
Example: 
The Marketing Manager has a Rule like "if a new product feature is released, write a blog post about it". The Engineering Manager notifies the Marketing Manager that the new feature is ready, and the Marketing Manager will automatically write a blog post about it.
But the Engineering Manager doesn't have to know or care about that... they can get back to reviewing code and let the Marketing Manager run with it.

Think of `Notify Teammates` to be a "fire-and-forget" message while `Delegate Task` is a critical part of the teammate's workflow.
