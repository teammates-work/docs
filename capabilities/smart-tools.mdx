Smart Tools are connections between Teammates and the digital software applications that you and your team use every day, such as Salesforce, JIRA, Notion, and more. 

By giving your AI teammates access to these tools, they can work just like a member of your team with secure access to work with your business data and perform tasks across your technology stack. Each integration is carefully designed to maintain security while enabling AI teammates to help with tasks like managing customer data, sending communications, analyzing spreadsheets, and more.

### Giving a Teammate Access to Smart Tools

Each teammate in your account can be given their own access to a Smart Tool, with their own credentials and whatever level of access you want to give them.

Note that different software applications have different ways of granting access to non-human users such as OAuth, API keys, or access tokens. The Teammates platform supports all of the various ways of granting access for each Smart Tool.

### Adding a Smart Tool

To give a teammate access to a Smart Tool, click the "Smart Tools" link in their profile. Search for the Smart Tool you want to add, click "Connect", and follow the instructions to grant access.
You will likely need to login to the 3rd party application to find your API key or start an OAuth flow. 

<Tip>
When given the option, it's always best to give your teammate their _own_ credentials for the Smart Tool so they can operate as _themselves_, not as you.
</Tip>

#### Adding Additional Context

Sometimes you'll want to store additional context or instructions about how to use a Smart Tool so you and your teammate don't have to remember it every time. For example, maybe you have a default Slack channel, an Airtable base, or a Mailchimp List ID that you're always going to use. You can add these fields to the Smart Tool context and it will be automatically used whenever the teammate uses the Smart Tool.

### Removing a Smart Tool

To remove a Smart Tool from a teammate, click the "Smart Tools" link in their profile. Search for the Smart Tool you want to remove, click "Disconnect".
