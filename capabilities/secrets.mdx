Teammates can store and retrieve sensitive information like passwords, API keys, and other secrets to securely log into websites, access databases, or make API calls.

<Note>
Secrets are stored encrypted at rest using AES-256-GCM encryption and only transmitted over a secure connections.
</Note>

To add a secret, click the "Profile" link and then "Edit". Each secret has a unique name which you will use to reference it later:

```
Name: website_admin_password
Value: sw0rdfish
```
or
```
Name: stripe_api_key
Value: sk_live_24601
```


Now, whenever you assign work to a teammate or update their Handbook, you can reference the secret with special template syntax like this:

> "Browse to https://admin.example.com and log in with username `admin` and password `${website_admin_password}`"

The teammate will automatically swap out the template variable `${website_admin_password}` with the value of the secret.

<Note>
Secrets can be used for any "password" fields, which are currently supported in the following skills:
- **Browse Web:** Browse the web and return the contents of the page
- **Query Database:** Execute SQL queries against a PostgreSQL database
