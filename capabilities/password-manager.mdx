Teammates can store and retrieve sensitive information like passwords, API keys, and other secrets to securely log into websites, access databases, or make API calls.

To add a password, click the "Profile" link and then "Edit". Each password has a unique name which you can use to securely reference it later:

```
Name: website_admin_password
Value: sw0rdfish
```
or
```
Name: stripe_api_key
Value: sk_live_24601
```


Now, whenever you assign work to a teammate or update their Handbook, you can reference the password securely by using special template syntax like this:

> "Browse to https://admin.example.com and log in with username `admin` and password `${website_admin_password}`"

The teammate will automatically swap out the template variable `${website_admin_password}` with the value of the password.

<Note>
The Password Manager can be used for any "password" fields, which are currently supported in the following skills:
- **Browse Web:** Browse the web and return the contents of the page
- **Query Database:** Execute SQL queries against a PostgreSQL database
</Note>
