## Here are some best practices for getting started working with your Teammates.

- **Start off Slowly** — Rather than assigning a super complex task, start with a few simple ones "e.g. did you get this email?" or "can you summarize this document for me?"
- **Start with Low Risk Tasks** — We don't recommend giving your Teammate your credit card on the first day. Instead, start with low-risk back-office tasks that are easy to complete and if things go wrong, it's not a big deal.
- **Give them Feedback** — It feels magical to just say "Do your work!" and have the Teammate complete it. But just like a new hire, you'll need to give them feedback on their work and ramp them up over time.
- **Teammates Get Smarter** - If something doesn't work, don't get frustrated. Instead, use it as an opportunity to teach them something new. Give them more information in their handbook, tweak their Skills, and add/remove Smart Tools.
- **Have Fun with Them!** - Teammates have unique personalities (which you give them). Lean into it! Work doesn't have to be boring, and the more fun you have with them, the more you'll want to work with them and discover new use cases.
