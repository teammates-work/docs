### Human Users
There are three types of human users in the system:

* **Owners** - Full account access including billing and account deletion
* **Admins** - Can manage teammates, other users, and account settings
* **Members** - Can view and interact with teammates and assignments but cannot manage the account

Logins with Google Workspace and Microsoft 365 accounts are currently supported. Please contact Sales if you need alternative login methods.

<Note>
Only people with a Teammates user account will be able to interact with your teammates via Slack. This is a security measure to prevent random people from assigning work or asking your teammates questions without your explicit permission.
