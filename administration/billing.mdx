Teammates platform is a subscription service with a usage-based component for work done. Our goal is to offer [flexible pricing plans](https://teammates.work/pricing) that meet the needs of teams of all sizes. Customers will pay a monthly fee based on features and anticipated usage volume, then a transaction fee for individual assignments.

<Note>
Teammates don't work for free (their union rep negotiated fiercely ðŸ˜‰). You'll need to "pay" them with Credits for any real work that they do.
</Note>

### Credits
Each [Assignment](/capabilities/assignments) that a Teammate successfully completes costs 1 Credit. You can buy additional Credits at any time via the [Billing Dashboard](https://app.teammates.work/settings/billing). Some pricing plans also include a bundle of Credits per month included as part of the plan. Credits are non-refundable and expire after 12 months.

### Managing Your Plan
You can upgrade and downgrade your plan at any time via the [Billing Dashboard](https://app.teammates.work/settings/billing). Upgrades or downgrades in the middle of a billing cycle will be prorated. You can also cancel your subscription at any time.

### Free Trial
Teammates offers a free trial of our Business plan with a limited number of free Credits. You can sign up for a free trial on our [Pricing Page](https://teammates.work/pricing). In order to buy additional Credits beyond the trial limit, you will need to upgrade to a paid plan with a credit card or service contract. Contact sales@teammates.work for more information.
