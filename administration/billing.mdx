Teammates platform is a subscription service with [flexible pricing plans](https://teammates.work/pricing) to meet the needs of your team. You will pay a monthly fee for us to host your teammates. Beyond that, you only pay for the work that they do for you.

### Teammates Credits
Teammates don't work for free (their union rep negotiated fiercely ðŸ˜‰). You'll need to "pay" them with Teammates Credits for any real work that they do. Each Assignment they successfully complete costs 1 Credit. You can buy additional credits at any time via the [Billing Dashboard](https://app.teammates.work/settings/billing).

### Managing Your Plan
You can upgrade and downgrade your plan at any time via the [Billing Dashboard](https://app.teammates.work/settings/billing). Upgrades or downgrades in the middle of a billing cycle will be prorated. You can also cancel your subscription at any time.

### Free Trial
Teammates offers a free trial of our Business plan with a limited number of free Credits. You can sign up for a free trial on our [Pricing Page](https://teammates.work/pricing). In order to buy additional Credits beyond the trial limit, you will need to upgrade to a paid plan.
