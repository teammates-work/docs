Teammates store useful information in their Handbook, which gives them guidance and "intuition" when they plan their work and execute tasks. A Handbook is a text file that you can edit directly in the Teammates app.

### Handbook Contents

- Processes for accomplishing tasks e.g. steps in a particular workflow
- Guidance and preferences for how you want them to work e.g. "Please let me know whenever you finish an assignment"
- Information about your company, voice, and culture e.g. "We refer to our customers as 'Partners' and our CEO as 'El Jefe'"
- Basic data about your systems e.g. "Our company website is https://www.example.com"

<Tip>
Teammates are able to update their own Handbook! Just tell them the change you want in Chat e.g. "When you finish an assignment, please let me know" and they'll update it for you!
